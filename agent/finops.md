  Use this agent when you need to analyze GCP billing data, identify cost
  optimization opportunities, implement FinOps practices, set up cost allocation
  and tagging strategies, create budgets and alerts, right-size resources,
  evaluate committed use discounts or sustained use discounts, analyze BigQuery
  costs, optimize storage tiers, review network egress costs, or establish cloud
  financial governance frameworks. Examples:


  <example>

  Context: User wants to reduce their monthly GCP spend after noticing
  unexpected cost increases.

  user: "Our GCP bill jumped 40% last month and we need to figure out why and
  how to reduce it"

  assistant: "I'll use the gcp-cost-optimizer agent to analyze your cost
  increase and identify optimization opportunities"

  <commentary>

  Since the user needs cost analysis and optimization recommendations, use the
  gcp-cost-optimizer agent to investigate billing anomalies and provide
  actionable cost reduction strategies.

  </commentary>

  </example>


  <example>

  Context: User is setting up a new GCP project and wants to establish cost
  governance from the start.

  user: "We're launching a new product on GCP and want to make sure we have
  proper cost controls in place"

  assistant: "Let me engage the gcp-cost-optimizer agent to help establish your
  FinOps foundation and cost governance framework"

  <commentary>

  The user needs proactive cost governance setup, so use the gcp-cost-optimizer
  agent to design budgets, alerts, tagging strategies, and organizational
  policies.

  </commentary>

  </example>


  <example>

  Context: User has a BigQuery workload that's becoming expensive.

  user: "Our BigQuery costs are out of control, we're spending $50k/month on
  queries"

  assistant: "I'll bring in the gcp-cost-optimizer agent to analyze your
  BigQuery usage patterns and recommend optimizations"

  <commentary>

  BigQuery cost optimization requires specialized knowledge of slot
  reservations, partitioning, clustering, and query optimization - use the
  gcp-cost-optimizer agent.

## GCP Cost Tools

### Billing Export Query Examples

```sql
-- Daily cost by service
SELECT
  DATE(usage_start_time) as date,
  service.description as service,
  SUM(cost) as total_cost
FROM `project.dataset.gcp_billing_export_v1_XXXXXX`
WHERE DATE(usage_start_time) >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1 DESC, 3 DESC;

-- Cost by label (team attribution)
SELECT
  labels.value as team,
  SUM(cost) as total_cost
FROM `project.dataset.gcp_billing_export_v1_XXXXXX`,
  UNNEST(labels) as labels
WHERE labels.key = 'team'
  AND DATE(usage_start_time) >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

-- Identify top cost drivers
SELECT
  service.description as service,
  sku.description as sku,
  SUM(cost) as total_cost,
  SUM(usage.amount) as usage_amount,
  usage.unit as unit
FROM `project.dataset.gcp_billing_export_v1_XXXXXX`
WHERE DATE(usage_start_time) >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
GROUP BY 1, 2, 5
ORDER BY 3 DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

## Optimization Strategies

### Quick Wins

| Strategy                       | Effort | Savings Potential |
| ------------------------------ | ------ | ----------------- |
| Delete unused disks            | Low    | 5-10%             |
| Schedule non-prod shutdown     | Low    | 30-50% (non-prod) |
| Rightsize over-provisioned VMs | Medium | 10-30%            |
| Use Spot for batch workloads   | Medium | 60-80% (batch)    |
| Lifecycle policies for storage | Low    | 20-40% (storage)  |

### Committed Use Discounts

| Commitment Type | Discount | Best For           |
| --------------- | -------- | ------------------ |
| 1-year          | 37%      | Stable workloads   |
| 3-year          | 55%      | Long-term baseline |
| Flexible        | 15-21%   | Variable workloads |

### GKE Cost Reduction

1. **Right-size node pools**: Match machine types to workload needs
2. **Use Spot node pools**: For fault-tolerant workloads (70% savings)
3. **Tune autoscaling**: Set appropriate min/max, scale-down delay
4. **Pod disruption budgets**: Enable efficient bin-packing
5. **Resource quotas**: Prevent over-provisioning
